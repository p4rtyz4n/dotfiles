## Usage

### Synopsis

Clone this repository and bootstrap your system:

    git clone git@github.com:p4rtyz4n/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    ./bootstrap

The bootstrap script will ask you whether you'd like to setup specific components.

### Dotfile Management

The POSIX shell script [dots](dots) installs (= symlinks) and removes subsets
of dotfiles according to your needs. For example, install all dotfiles as
follows:

    ./dots install -a

Alternatively, install only dotfiles selectively, with positional arguments
matching names in this repository:

    ./dots install git gnupg

Similarly, remove all installed dotfiles:

    ./dots uninstall -a

The installer script does not override existing dotfiles unless the command
line includes the `-f` switch. When in doubt what the installation of a subset
of the dotfiles would look like, it is possible to look at the diff first:

    ./dots diff -a

To add a configuration for an exemplary tool "foo", create a new directory
`foo` and add the dotfiles in there, as if `foo` is your install prefix
(typically `$HOME`). You can "scope" a tool as *local* by adding a tag-file
`foo/LOCAL`. This has the effect of creating a nested configuration directory
in your prefix, instead of symlinking the directory. For example, you may not
want to symlink `~/.gnupg` but only the contained file `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`.
Without the scope tag `gnupg/LOCAL`, you would end up with:

    ~/.gnupg -> dotfiles/gpg/.gnupg

as opposed to:

    ~/.gnupg (local directory)
    ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf -> dotfiles/gpg/.gnupg/gpg.conf
